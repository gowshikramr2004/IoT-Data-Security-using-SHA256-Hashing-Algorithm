# IoT Data Security using SHA256 Hashing Algorithm

This project demonstrates how to use SHA256 hashing to secure data collected from a DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor on an Arduino board. The code is designed to be user-friendly and interactive, allowing users to input their own data for hashing.

## Requirements

- Arduino board (e.g. Arduino Uno)
- DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor
- SHA256 library (can be installed through Arduino Library Manager)
- DHT library (can be installed through Arduino Library Manager)

## Usage

1. Connect the DHT11 sensor to pin 2 of the Arduino board.
2. Upload the code to the Arduino board.
3. Open the serial monitor to view the temperature, humidity, and hash values.

## Result

The project successfully implements SHA256 hashing to secure the data collected from the DHT11 sensor. Users can easily input their own data for hashing, making it a flexible solution for securing data from other sensors or sources.

## Conclusion

This project highlights the importance of securing sensitive data in IoT devices and demonstrates how SHA256 hashing can be used to protect such information. The code is user-friendly and can be easily adapted for use with other sensors or sources of data.
