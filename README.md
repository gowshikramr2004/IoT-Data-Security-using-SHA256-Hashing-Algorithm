# IoT-Data-Security-using-SHA256-Hashing-Algorithm
This project implements a SHA256 hashing algorithm on an Arduino board to secure data collected from a DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor. The code is user-friendly and interactive, allowing users to easily input their own data for hashing. This project demonstrates the importance of securing sensitive data in IoT devices
